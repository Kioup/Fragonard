Mobile App projet maded in my course

To run the app properly you have to install 3 - 4 things using command lines, in addition to the ionic and android dependencies :

Installing bower -> npm install bower;
Installing the NgMap plugin -> bower install ngmap;
Installing Geolocation plugin -> cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-geolocation;
Installing ngCordova -> bower install ngCordova

You shouldn't got issue if you followed the instructions

now you also have to install database in the root directory of your databases manager (e.g phpmyadmin).
then you have to put the API file in the right directory !important! so in the main directory of your localserver, where you may access all your webproject you may creat a "tests" directory if not exists and put the API "index.php" in that folder.

If you have any troubles with that, please leave comments !
